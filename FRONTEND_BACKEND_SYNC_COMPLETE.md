# Frontend-Backend Synchronization Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully synchronized the frontend with all backend routes and controllers, fixed database schema mismatches, and added comprehensive API endpoints for all features.

---

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Column Name Mismatches
**Problem:** Controllers were using old column names that didn't match the actual database schema.

**Fixed:**
- `songController.ts`: 
  - `AlbumArt` → `AlbumCover`
  - `SongLength` → `Duration`
  - `SongFile` → `FilePath`
  - Fixed JOIN logic (song now directly references artist)
  
- `albumController.ts`:
  - `AlbumArt` → `AlbumCover`
  - `AlbumDate` → `ReleaseDate`
  - `AlbumDescription` → `Description`

### 2. Song Upload Error
**Problem:** `require('multer')` call in ES module causing "require is not defined" error.

**Fixed:** Removed duplicate multer configuration in upload endpoint, now uses the already-configured `uploadMusic` instance from the top of the file.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Backend Usage
All new routes are now available at `http://localhost:3001/api/*`

The server automatically reloaded with nodemon, so all changes are live.

### Frontend Usage
Import and use the new API functions:

```typescript
import { 
  userApi, 
  playlistApi, 
  likeApi, 
  followApi, 
  historyApi 
} from './services/api';

// Example: Create a playlist
const response = await playlistApi.create({
  playlistName: 'My Favorites',
  userId: 1,
  isPublic: true
});

// Example: Like a song
await likeApi.likeSong(userId, songId);

// Example: Get trending songs
const trending = await historyApi.getTrending({ days: 7 });
```
