### 6. **index.ts** ✅
Central export file for all controllers:
```typescript
export * as authController from './authController.js';
export * as songController from './songController.js';
export * as albumController from './albumController.js';
export * as artistController from './artistController.js';
export * as genreController from './genreController.js';
export * as playlistController from './playlistController.js';
export * as userController from './userController.js';
export * as likeController from './likeController.js';
export * as followController from './followController.js';
export * as historyController from './historyController.js';
```

## Updated Types

Added to `backend/src/types/index.ts`:
- `Playlist` - Playlist interface
- `CreatePlaylistData` - Data for creating playlists
- `UpdatePlaylistData` - Data for updating playlists
- `UpdateUserData` - Data for updating user profiles
- `ListeningHistory` - Listening history interface
- `AddListeningHistoryData` - Data for adding listening history

## Database Schema Alignment

All controllers are aligned with the SQLite schema in `backend/src/schema.sqlite.sql`:

| Table | Controller | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| `userprofile` | authController, userController | ✅ Complete |
| `artist` | artistController | ✅ Complete |
| `genre` | genreController | ✅ Complete |
| `album` | albumController | ✅ Complete |
| `song` | songController | ✅ Complete |
| `playlist` | playlistController | ✅ Complete |
| `playlist_song` | playlistController | ✅ Complete |
| `user_follows_artist` | followController | ✅ Complete |
| `user_likes_song` | likeController | ✅ Complete |
| `user_likes_album` | likeController | ✅ Complete |
| `user_likes_playlist` | likeController | ✅ Complete |
| `listening_history` | historyController | ✅ Complete |

## Implementation Notes

1. **Architecture Pattern**: All new controllers follow the same pattern as existing controllers:
   - Use `better-sqlite3` Database object
   - Pure functions with database as first parameter
   - No classes, only exported functions
   - Proper error handling with descriptive messages
   - Type safety with TypeScript interfaces

2. **Error Handling**: All controllers include:
   - Existence checks for related entities
   - Unique constraint validation
   - Foreign key validation
   - Clear error messages

3. **Pagination**: Where applicable, controllers support pagination with `page` and `limit` parameters

4. **SQL Queries**: All queries use:
   - Prepared statements for security
   - JOINs to fetch related data
   - Proper indexing considerations

## Note on Compilation Errors

The TypeScript compilation shows errors in the **models** directory (albumModel, artistModel, followModel, etc.). These are legacy models from the MySQL implementation that haven't been migrated to SQLite yet. The newly created **controllers** compile successfully with no errors.

The models use MySQL's `pool.query()` API which doesn't exist in better-sqlite3. These models are not currently used since the controllers implement the database operations directly using the better-sqlite3 API.

## Next Steps

To use these new controllers in the server:
1. Import the controllers in `server.ts`
2. Create API routes that call the controller functions
3. Add proper authentication middleware
4. Implement request validation
